                  <p>Praia de Benagil
                  One of the most iconic and heavily photographed caves in the Algarve is located near Carvoeiro in a fishing village
                  called Benagil. The Algar de Benagil is a main standout feature of the local beach and is only accessible by water
                  (travel by boat is the easiest). The Praia de Benagil is much more than this singular “algar” or grotto, however, and is
                  one of the quieter and more secluded spots due to limited parking spaces nearby; also, it is surrounded by steep
                  cliffsides that are common in the Algarv </p>

            mountain peaks, the highest of which is Robson, as well as pristine lakes, diverse flora and fauna and numerous resort

              <p>About 90 minutes outside of Denver, Estes Park, Colorado, is the adorable, remote town at the foothills of Rocky
              Mountain National Park. Stay in town – where you’ll be surrounded by wild elk – and take the “Road to the Sky” in the
              Rocky Mountains for incredible views, hiking, picnics and more wildlife sightings. Estes Park is also home to The
              Stanley Hotel, the haunted hotel that inspired Stephen King to write “The Shining.” Yes, that’s how remote this little
              town is, making it perfect for a family vacation in the wilderness.

              <h3>rise in the mountains</h3>
              <p>Like icebergs or ships in water, continents and their mountains “float” on the denser mantle. High mountains such as the
              Himalayas are balanced by a keel, or root, that penetrates deeper into the mantle. As the mountains are worn down by
              erosion, the weight of the crust is reduced, and the mountains rise.
